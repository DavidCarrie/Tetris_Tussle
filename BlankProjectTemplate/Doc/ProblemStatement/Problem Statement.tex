\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{What is the problem to be solved?}

With the recent emergence of large scale triple A Battle Royale games flooding the market there has been an absence of puzzle games that require quick decision making and careful planning.  We have decided to put a spin on a simple but beloved classic to fill in that void. Tetris took the world by storm in the 1980â€™s becoming the first hit game ever created. Selling over 202 million copies. 

 We are looking to take a barebones version of this game and update it to better suit the modern standards of gaming.  
 

\subsection{Why is this problem important?}

Many people are locked indoors due to COVID this disruption in daily life has cause many people to feel depressed and isolated. The need to feel entertained and connected with other people is important now more than ever. An outlet like our game can be used to combat these feelings and help the general population as this outbreak comes to an end. As the current version stands, it lacks multiplayer functionality as well as any sort of attractive UI. Updating these features and adding player versus player functionality is crucial to adding depth and replayability to the game.  

\subsection{What is the problems context?}

The game is suitable for all ages and only requires a computer and an internet browser to be able to play. The game is not hardware intensive and can be played on most personal computers.
